# CS50x Progress – Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science

I am currently enrolled in [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/), Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science. This course explores foundational concepts in programming, data structures, algorithms, memory, and web development, with hands-on problem sets in C, Python, and more.

### Current Status: In Progress (Week 8)

This repository serves as a placeholder to document my progress through the course. In adherence to CS50’s academic honesty policy, I will refrain from uploading solutions until I have completed the course and it is appropriate to share them.

### Why Solutions Are Not Yet Public

To maintain academic integrity and prevent potential misuse of coursework, all code and solutions remain private during the duration of the course. Once I have completed CS50x and the final deadline has passed, I intend to make the following available:

- Cleaned and well-documented code for each problem set  
- Descriptions of the approaches taken for each challenge  
- Personal reflections and key takeaways from each topic  

### Topics Covered So Far

- Week 0: Scratch – Introduction to logic, event-driven programming, and problem decomposition using MIT Scratch
- Week 1: C – Low-level programming fundamentals, syntax, functions, variables, and control structures
- Week 2: Arrays – Introduction to data representation, strings, loops, and memory layout in C
- Week 3: Algorithms – Problem-solving with search (linear, binary) and sort (selection, bubble, merge) algorithms
- Week 4: Memory – Pointers, memory allocation, files, and debugging with valgrind
- Week 5: Data Structures – Linked lists, hash tables, tries, and implementing custom data structures in C
- Week 6: Python – Transition from C to Python, exploring higher-level programming, data types, and readability
- Week 7: SQL – Data modeling and querying using SQL, understanding relationships and data normalization
- Week 8: HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Building interactive web pages, styling with CSS, and dynamic behavior with JavaScript  

### What's Ahead

In the coming weeks, I will be diving deeper into:
- Flask – Building web apps with Python on the backend
- Software Engineering Principles – Encapsulation, testing, maintainability
- Security – Common vulnerabilities and secure coding practices
- Final Project – Designing, building, and presenting an original software project

### Closing Note

CS50 has been an enriching and rewarding introduction to computer science that has deepened my understanding of programming fundamentals and problem-solving techniques. I look forward to completing the course and applying these skills to more advanced projects and real-world challenges.

Updates will follow upon course completion.
